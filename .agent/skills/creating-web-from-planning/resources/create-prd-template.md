# PRD Template for Web Projects

This is the required structure for all PRDs generated by this skill. Each section must be present.

## Sections

1. **Executive Summary** — 2-3 paragraphs, core value proposition, MVP goal
2. **Mission** — Mission statement + 3-5 core principles
3. **Target Users** — Personas, technical level, needs/pain points
4. **MVP Scope** — ✅ In Scope / ❌ Out of Scope (grouped by category)
5. **User Stories** — 5-8 stories in "As a [user], I want [action], so that [benefit]" format
6. **Core Architecture & Patterns** — TWO architectures:
   - Development: React + Vite file tree
   - Final: Static HTML file tree with `components/header.html` and `components/footer.html`
7. **Features/Pages** — Detailed spec per page. For each page:
   - Purpose and target content
   - Sections with exact text (from planning/scraped content)
   - Images needed (with source)
   - Interactive elements (forms, maps, galleries)
8. **Technology Stack** — Development stack AND final deliverable stack
9. **Configuration** — Environment variables, API keys, third-party service configs
10. **Forms & Integrations** — Field-level spec for every form. Submission method. Validation rules.
11. **Success Criteria** — ✅ checklist, performance targets (Lighthouse), accessibility (WCAG)
12. **Implementation Phases** — ALWAYS 5 phases:
    - Phase 1: Setup + Design system
    - Phase 2: Main pages
    - Phase 3: Features + Responsive
    - Phase 4: Testing + Temporary deploy
    - Phase 5: HTML static conversion
13. **Future Considerations** — Post-MVP enhancements
14. **Risks & Mitigations** — 3-5 key risks
15. **Appendix** — Image inventory, content sources, reference links

## Critical Rules

- Use **real content** from the planning document. No placeholder text.
- Specify **exact colors** (hex codes), **fonts**, and **spacing** if available.
- Include an **image inventory table** listing every image needed.
- Match the **language** of the planning document (usually Spanish).
- The PRD filename should be `PRD.md` in the project root.
